 The project contains assembly language code for a candy crush game that is 3 levels long.
 
 Each level is a different difficulty. The bombs in the candy crush game can appear randomly on the board. Everytime you swap the bomb with a candy, all candies of that types will start blinking and blow up.
 
 To the start the game first type your name, press space bar, type the level you would like to play (1,2,3), press space bar again and then press enter. You can read the rules of the game and then you press enter.
 
 The points will only show after the game has ended and you will have 15 moves in total. The points will differ for the combinations you make for example a combination of 4 will be more points than a combination of 3.
